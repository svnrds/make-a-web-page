					<h3>The Web</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="topic-body">
					<p>
              			The Web was invented in the early 1990s. It is a collection of HTML documents with are all stored on servers. These documents are accessed by a user through a browser, which uses HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to access the servers over the Internet. At the time this lesson was created there were approximately 30 
              <em>billion</em> HTML pages.

					<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="topic-body">
					<p>
              			HTML is the lanuage used to display text content and modify how it looks. The "modify how it looks" is called Markup.
           			</p>
            		<p> 
              			Elements are sections of content denoted by tags like:
              			<code>
                			&lt;b&gt;boldnes&lt;/b&gt;
              			</code>
              			The entire line is an element, while the 
              			<code>
                			&lt; &gt;
              			</code> 
              			parts are the tags. Elements are either inline or block. the example of the bold tags above is an example of inline tags. All it does to bold the text between the tags. Block tags on the other hand, set up an "invisible box" around the element. Not all tags need the closing tag, but not including one that is needed can cause the enitre document to be problematic. This was presented as "Computers are Stupid". The computer will do whateverit is told to do, even if it is wrong. (infinite loops)

					<h3>There are 3 main parts to a web page:</h3>

				<div class="topic-body">
					<aside>
              			DOM- Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
          			</aside>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>HTML</h4> 
							<p>
								The standard markup language used to create web pages.
							</p>
							<p>
              					HTML pages are organized in blocks. You can nest blocks inside each other. When viewing the source code, you can visually see nesting with the wave of indentions in the left margin of the lines. Representing this as a tree structure is known as the DOM.
            				</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>CSS</h4> 
							<p>
								style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.

						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Javascript</h4>

					<h3>Repitition is the Devil</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="topic-body">
					<p>
						As a coder, repition is awful. Writing the same code over and over can lead to bugs with can be hard to track down since it will be hard to find the correct lines of code to squash that were copied and pasted.
					</p>
					<p>
						Repitition also makes it harder later to make changes. If code was simply copied and pasted, then every instance would have to be modified to make even the smallest change.
					</p>
					<p>
						Programming languages have ways to avoid code repition. for HTML, it is CSS: Cascading Style Sheets.
